# Bundstreg

> Functional alternatives to many native JavaScript methods and then some

[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/kasperisager/bundstreg.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/kasperisager/bundstreg)

Bundstreg is a set of utility functions designed to replace many native JavaScript methods with often faster alternatives in the same vein as [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), and the likes. The thing that Bundstreg does differently from these libraries is its focus on minimalism and speed. Functions found in Bundstreg are rarely generic and make quite a few assumptions about the data that you pass them. If in doubt then you probably want to use another library.
